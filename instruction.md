🏛️ About PCMA
Private Client Merchant Association
Representing the Private Banking Side of the Merchant Services Industry
Who We Are
Private Client Merchant Association (PCMA) is a national consulting and financial services organization representing the private client and private banking side of the payments industry.
Our group works in strategic collaboration with First Data, Fiserv, Clover, Worldpay, Global Payments, and Q-SYS to provide direct access to elite merchant programs, advanced technology, and transparent financial solutions.
We specialize in unlimited processing for a low monthly membership fee, no-cost equipment programs, and enterprise-level marketing and loyalty systems — giving business owners the same level of financial sophistication and protection that global corporations receive.
With over $11.2 billion in processed volume and tens of thousands of clients nationwide, PCMA has become one of the most trusted private merchant associations in the U.S.
Our Mission
To elevate and humanize the payments industry by creating a private-client standard built on transparency, inclusion, and performance.
We believe every entrepreneur — regardless of size or industry — deserves direct banking access, enterprise-grade tools, and ethical representation.
Our mission extends beyond processing transactions: we protect businesses from predatory processors, eliminate hidden costs, and restore confidence in the financial infrastructure that powers American commerce.
Our Compliance Charter: 6 % Inclusion Policy
As part of our private-banking mandate, PCMA is required to maintain a minimum of 6 % low-risk merchant portfolios.
This ensures that small and mid-sized businesses receive the same rates, programs, and protections available to high-volume enterprise accounts.
Through this initiative, we strengthen our nationwide ecosystem — building trust, balance, and opportunity across all merchant categories.
Our Vision
To be the nation’s most respected private-client merchant network, empowering businesses to grow with unlimited scalability, transparent pricing, and concierge-level support.
We envision a financial landscape where merchants operate with clarity, fairness, and direct access to the world’s most powerful payment technologies.
Our Values
Integrity & Transparency — We disclose every rate, fee, and policy upfront.
Access & Inclusion — Our 6 % low-risk commitment ensures equal opportunity.
Protection — We defend merchants from hidden fees, predatory agents, and deceptive practices.
Partnership — We measure success through long-term relationships, not short-term gain.
Innovation — From geofencing to loyalty programs, we deliver enterprise tools to main-street businesses.
Leadership
PCMA’s leadership team includes executives and advisors with deep experience in financial technology, risk management, ISO development, and private banking operations.
Together, they bring more than a decade of collaboration with Fiserv, First Data, Clover, Worldpay, Global Payments, and Q-SYS, ensuring that our members operate with the highest standards of compliance and precision.
(Optional: executive bios and photos can be inserted here for credibility.)
